# PoTRA-Pathways-of-Topological-Rank-Analysis
PoTRA is motivated by the observation that the loss of connectivity is a common topological trait of cancer networks and the prior knowledge that a normal biological network is a scale-free network whose degree distribution follows a power law where a small number of nodes are hubs and a large number of nodes are non-hubs. From normal to cancer, the process of the network losing connectivity might be the process of disrupting the scale-free structure of the network, which can result in an altered number of hub genes between normal and cancer. The PoTRA analysis is based on topological ranks of genes in biological pathways, and PoTRA detects pathways involved in cancer by testing if the number of hub genes in pathways is altered between normal and cancer. We are using Fisher’s exact test to estimate if the number of hub genes is significantly altered between normal and cancer, which is a local test of the distribution (we only look at hub genes). Alternatively, we also use F test to estimate if the variance of the distribution is significantly altered between normal and cancer, which is a global test of the distribution. The F test is a good complement to Fisher’s exact test.
